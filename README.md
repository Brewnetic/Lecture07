# **Class Examples**

## **Lecture 7: Intro to Object-Oriented Programming**

### **📝 Ex 1: Creating a Simple Class**

* **Files**: MovieExample.java  
* **Topic**: Creating a class with properties, instance methods, and objects to represent movies in a streaming service.  
* **Learning Goals**:  
  * Understand how to define a class with properties (fields).  
  * Create instance methods that operate on object data.  
  * Instantiate objects from a class using the `new` keyword.  
  * Access and modify object properties using dot notation.  
  * Call instance methods on specific objects.

### **📝 Ex 2: Constructors and Static vs Instance Methods**

* **Files**: RestaurantExample.java  
* **Topic**: Creating a Restaurant class with constructors, instance methods, and static methods to track individual restaurant data and overall statistics.  
* **Learning Goals**:  
  * Define a constructor that initializes object properties when created.  
  * Use the `this` keyword to distinguish between parameters and instance variables.  
  * Create instance methods (non-static) that work with specific object data.  
  * Create static methods (class methods) that belong to the class itself.  
  * Understand when to use instance methods vs static methods.  
  * Call static methods directly on the class name vs calling instance methods on objects.
